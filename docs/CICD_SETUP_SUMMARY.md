## Dependencies Added

Installed semantic-release and plugins:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "semantic-release": "^24.2.1",
    "@semantic-release/changelog": "^6.0.3",
    "@semantic-release/git": "^10.0.1",

}
```

---

## What Happens Now

### On Every Push/PR

1. Tests run automatically
2. Code is built and verified
3. Dependencies are scanned
4. Security analysis runs
5. Coverage reports generated

### On Push to Main (with conventional commits)

1. Semantic-release analyzes commits
2. Determines next version number
3. Generates changelog
4. Creates Git tag
5. Publishes to npm
6. Creates GitHub release
7. Comments on related issues/PRs

---

## Next Steps

### Required Setup (5 minutes)

1. **Add npm Token to GitHub Secrets:**
   - Get token from https://www.npmjs.com/settings/tokens
   - Add as `NPM_TOKEN` in repo secrets
   - See: [QUICK_START_CICD.md](./QUICK_START_CICD.md)

2. **Enable GitHub Actions:**
   - Settings → Actions → General
   - Set "Read and write permissions"
   - Allow creating PRs

3. **Test the Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "ci: add GitHub Actions workflows"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Optional Setup

4. **Add Codecov Token** (for coverage tracking)
   - Sign up at https://codecov.io
   - Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` to secrets

5. **Protect Main Branch**
   - Settings → Branches
   - Require status checks before merge

6. **Add Status Badges to README**
   ```markdown
   [![CI](https://github.com/NabarupDev/Editium/workflows/CI%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/NabarupDev/Editium/actions)
   [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/editium.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/editium)
   ```

## Commit Message Convention

Use these prefixes for automatic versioning:

| Prefix | Version Bump | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `feat:` | Minor (1.0.0 → 1.1.0) | `feat: add table support` |
| `fix:` | Patch (1.0.0 → 1.0.1) | `fix: correct toolbar bug` |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | Major (1.0.0 → 2.0.0) | In commit body |
| `docs:`, `test:`, etc. | No bump | Updates without release |

**Example:**
```bash
# Minor version bump
git commit -m "feat(editor): add image resize feature"

# Patch version bump
git commit -m "fix(toolbar): correct alignment button"

# Major version bump
git commit -m "feat!: redesign API

BREAKING CHANGE: removed deprecated props"
```
